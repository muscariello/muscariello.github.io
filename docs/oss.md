# Open Source Projects

## ThreatCompute

[ThreatCompute](https://github.com/ThreatCompute/ThreatCompute) automates core phases of security analysis for cloud-native (Kubernetes) systems. It blends deterministic graph analytics with controlled LLM prompts to produce reproducible, explainable security artifacts including threat modeling, time-to-compromise estimation, and attack graph generation aligned with MITRE ATT&CK and Kubernetes threat matrices.

## AGNTCY

### Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF)

[OASF](https://github.com/agntcy/oasf) is a standardized schema system for defining and managing AI agent capabilities, interactions, and metadata. It provides a structured way to describe agent attributes, capabilities, and relationships using attribute-based taxonomies. The framework serves as the foundation for interoperable AI agent systems, enabling consistent definition and discovery of agent capabilities across distributed systems.

### Directory

[Directory](https://github.com/agntcy/dir) allows publication, exchange, and discovery of information about records over a distributed peer-to-peer network. It leverages OASF to describe AI agents and provides a set of APIs and tools to store, publish, and discover records across the network by their attributes and constraints.

### SLIM

[SLIM](https://github.com/agntcy/slim) (Secure Low-Latency Interactive Messaging) facilitates communication between AI agents. It supports various communication patterns such as unicast, anycast, and multicast groups. Built on the gRPC framework, SLIM ensures secure and scalable interactions among agents with end-to-end encryption using MLS (Messaging Layer Security).

## Agent2Agent (A2A) Project

The [A2A Project](https://github.com/a2aproject) is an open protocol enabling communication and interoperability between opaque agentic applications. Donated to the Linux Foundation by Google, it provides official SDKs for Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, and .NET, along with samples and validation tools for A2A agents.

## FD.io

### Vector Packet Processing (VPP)

[VPP](https://github.com/FDio/vpp) is an extensible framework that provides out-of-the-box production quality switch/router functionality. It is the open source version of Cisco's Vector Packet Processing technology: a high performance, packet-processing stack that can run on commodity CPUs. The platform is known for its high performance, proven technology, modularity, flexibility, and rich feature set.

### Hybrid Information-Centric Networking (hICN)

[hICN](https://github.com/FDio/hicn) is an open source implementation of Cisco's hybrid ICN. It includes a network stack that implements ICN forwarding path in IPv6, and a transport stack that implements reliable and unreliable transport with congestion control and loss management by ARQ or FEC. It supports applications such as reliable multicast for ABR video, real-time video conferencing, and online multiplayer games.

### Community ICN (CICN)

[CICN](https://github.com/FDio/cicn) was the original FD.io project for Information-Centric Networking containing multiple sub-projects: cicn-plugin (VPP forwarder), sb-forwarder (socket-based forwarder), libicnet (socket API), cframework, ccnxlibs, http-server, viper (Qt/QML video player), vicn framework, and Android SDK for ICN. This project has been archived and superseded by hICN.
